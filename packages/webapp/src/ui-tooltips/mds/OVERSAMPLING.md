**`Value Seeded`** proceeds by sampling attributes from the single attribute counts. When the sampling is performed, there might be some attribute combinations that are over sampled (synthetic count greater than the one reported on the reportable aggregate counts).

This allows the oversampling to be `Unlimited` or `Controlled` with some parameters.
