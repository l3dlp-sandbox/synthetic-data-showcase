This will run an analysis both on the sensitive microdata and the synthesized data, enabling a comparison between both.

The **`analysis length`** determines the maximum length of attribute combination for which aggregate counts are precomputed and reported. In the **`navigate`** step, this value determines how many attribute value selections an user may make while retaining the ability to compare estimated (synthetic) vs actual values.

Be aware that on an analysis basis, this might contain metrics and data directly related to the sensitive data.
