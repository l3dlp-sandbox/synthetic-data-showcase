Choose how to split the privacy budget between the combination lengths

**`Prioritize Large Counts`**:
Use this if you want to prioritize more accurate large counts (for example, 3-counts being more accurate than 2-counts).

**`Prioritize Small Counts`**:
Use this if you want to prioritize more accurate small counts (for example, 1-counts being more accurate than 2-counts).

**`Balanced`**:
Evenly split the privacy budget (epsilon) between 1-counts, 2-counts... up to the aggregation limit.
