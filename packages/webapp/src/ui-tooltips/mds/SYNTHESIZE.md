Runs the data synthesis based on the configured parameters. The resulting synthetic records will be presented as a table sorted by the number of non-empty attribute values.

Processing time ranges from a few seconds up to several minutes, depending on the size of the dataset, number of columns, and configured parameters.

There is also a **`download button`** on the table, so the synthetic data can be downloaded as a csv file.
