This will run the data synthesis based on the configured parameters and the synthetic records will be presented as a table sorted by number of non-empty attribute values.

The processing time might take only a few seconds up to several minutes, depending on the size of the dataset, number of columns and configured parameters.

There is also a **`download button`** on the table, so the synthetic data can be downloaded as csv.
